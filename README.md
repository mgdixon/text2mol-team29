# text2mol-team29
Project for UIUC 598 DLH to reproduce a paper [Text2Mol](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.47/) from [repo](https://github.com/cnedwards/text2mol/tree/master/code) 

All of the necessary code is in the .ipynb file.  Training code can be enabled by setting TRAIN_MLP, TRAIN_GCN, and TRAIN_TRANSFORMER to true.

According to the paper, the "programs and data are publicly available at
github.com/cnedwards/text2mol for research purposes."
