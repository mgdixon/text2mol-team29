The code was extremely poorly commented, so it was hard to understand what the authors intended. This took the better part of a week to debug. If the authors had supplied a requirements.txt file, it would have been easier to fix.\n",
        "* The code was additionally extremely unoptimized. A minor tweak to the loss computation by keeping the values on the GPU decreased step time by 10%.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Functions are your friends. Inheritance is even better. Try refactoring your code to make it easier to understand and profile.\n",
        "* Try performance profiling your code, you will find multiple instances where you can get 10% to 3x performance improvements.\n",
